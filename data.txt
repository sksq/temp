But the biriyani itself had no masala, there was hardly any flavor.. Dal curry as a side?? Come on, , biriyani without masala??\n\nWe also had one of their specialties- Alfaham Chicken- now there was the silver lining.. It was delicious; served with khubbus and a dip- not sure if it was hummus.\n\nBut the overall experience was appalling..

Also we were sitting next to the window. Given the crowd outside, it gets uncomfortable and feels like someone breathing down your nose when you eat.\nOverall Ambience - 3/5\nFor a place which has large crowds waiting, one expects the waiters to be quick to hand menus and be on the watch to take the orders. It might be a comparitively relaxed day in terms of crowd since it was lunch time on a weekday, but the waiters had to be really called for us to give the order. They also had to be reminded multiple times to provide glasses and extra plates.\nOn the food service itself, it was really quick. So quick that the burgers and chicken with veg and rice came almost instantaneously, they were then followed by the beverages and nachos and finally after some time did we get knock knock(the starter). This does knock of some points from the otherwise quick service. Staff was courteous throughout.\nOverall I'll give them a 3.5/5 on this. \nComing to the food itself - the chicken with veggies and rice was pretty average.\nThe burgers, while impressively large in size, were good, but I have had better. Not something I'd make a big fuss about.\nThe nachos were very good, and that is something I would recommend. The chips appeared to be Doritos.\nKnock knock, mentioned as a starter, was in sufficient quantity as a main dish. I would highly recommend this perfection of veggies baked in a cheese and potato base, topped with really fresh and fragment sauces and seasonings. The serving along with a beautiful arrangement of garlic bread is something I would create hope about. This dish gets a 5/5,.\nThe deserts were again, though good, not great.\nThe cheesecake was at room temperature. The same would have tasted much better had it been colder. Chocolate mud pie and the brownie, were again above average, but below didn't go further.\nOverall for the food 4/5.\nThis place was highly recommended by lot of friends, colleagues and online. This resulted in my expectations to be very high.

If you're from Delhi, you could say that this is the Ricos of Bangalore. I kid you not, this place is pretty damn divine. It's incredibly reasonable in spite of the quantities they provide and their food is on point. The menu is predominantly continental with mostly American, Italian and French fusion. But the ordinary run-of-the-mill main course platters and burgers are elevated to all new levels here, their legit. We ordered two All American Burgers, Chicken Tandoori Kebabs, A Mississippi Mud Pie and a Sliced strawberry cake. The burgers were HUGE, I kid you not, these were regulars and they were mind blowing, they're called the All Americans because they're two patties, one patty is meat (either lamb or chicken) and the other is fried cheese. FRIED CHEESE. They're 205 rupees for a regular.\nThe one who flew over the cuckoo's nest (chicken tandoori kebabs) were huge too and so freaking delicious, it's really saucy and spicy served with buttered vegetables, mash potatoes and some fried noodles. They're three skewers covered in chunky meat, it's pretty amazing. I highly recommend this on your visit if you're a hard core meat person. They don't serve beef or pork, but everything else is on point.\nThe joint is well decorated with white lighting and modern decor, it's a great place for great food and good conversation. The service is fast and there's no tax on the food, so most of my boxes are checked off.\nThe desserts on the other hand, deserve their own paragraph. The Mississippi mud pie is all I've been dreaming about for quite some time and that strawberry cake was light, fluffy and so summery, I loved them both. The three of us were stuffed for the whole day for 300 a person and honestly if you find yourself in Koramangala, hungry or not, head here. You'll be pleasantly surprised to find yourself changing plans just to make it back here whenever you can.\nIn spite of being pocket friendly, this is a place I would highly recommend irrespective of the depth of your pockets, it's a definite on my list.", "review_and_follow": ["18", "364"], "rating": "Rated 4.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2016-06-20 00:40:47", "likes": "0", "text": "Over hyped place.

Do not order an XL sized burger if you don't have an appetite.

And this is where Truffles wins my heart, that too a vegetarian heart!! :D\nI forget the name of the dish I ordered as I write, however it was something to do with soya-veg cutlet like things (mega sized!!!!) with herbed rice, mashed potatoes and vegetables. Totally YUM! Hogged like a pig..!!\nMy partner had a veggie burger, which was again excellent and no complaints there. \nAlso, what stole the show, was the Ferrero Rocher shake.. It was fan-friggin-tastic!!\n\nAll this we had for not even 500 bucks & now u know,why am I raving about this place! :)", "review_and_follow": ["29", "103"], "rating": "Rated 4.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2016-03-13 23:11:04", "likes": "0", "text": "Heard a lot of this place so finally visited today.

All American cheeseburger was good, as always. We decided to try the hickey on toast - veg (the description was mouthwatering). Never would we regret that decision. It was simply a treat for the taste buds as well as for the eyes, the way it was presented. Pastas - the carbonara in spaghetti and olive blasta pasta - were amazing. This we followed up with a Death By Chocolate. For those who are familiar with the DBC of Corner House, this would be a disappointment for the eyes, but you wouldn't complain after having a bite.\nPS: two of my friends had decided to rate the place 1 because of the waiting time, but the food changed their mind!

The waiter apologised and informed that they would require an additional 10mins as there was some miscommunication. After about 40mins I finally received my order and quickly dug in. The chicken steak, egg and grilled lamb patty were really good but the sausages were too oily and had a very nauseating after taste and so I decided to leave that aside. Barring that, I enjoyed the other components of my meal. I then ordered a ferrero rocher brownie for take out which was mistaken for a ferrero milkshake. Again I had to wait till the wait staff rectified their error. \n\nI enjoyed the food but unfortunately my experience was marred by shortcomings of the wait staff.

I tried the Peri Peri chicken burger and the Tex Mex chicken burger and both were extra ordinary. The burger buns, the sauce on the meat, everything perfect.\n\n3. Food and desserts: Other food on the menu is also great. I have tried the California chicken steak and the sauce was awesome. The Rasberry choco cake was awesome.\n\n4. Service: Quick and friendly. The Manager of this place is very friendly and offers wise suggestions on the food. Make sure you speak with the manager if you are confused about what to order.\n\n5.Ambiance: Very easy going, cosy and without any airs\n\n6. Price: Easy on the pocket and worth every penny\n\nMinuses:\n\n1. Small restaurant: This place being so popular gets filled up very soon since its a very small restaurant and hence one ends up waiting for a table even on weekdays.\n\n2. Parking : especially 4 wheeler could be a challenge since its in the crowded koramangala area.\n\n3. Oriental Cuisine: I tried the fire n spice prawn and it was average. The prawns were overcooked. Obviously Oriental cuisine is not their forte.\n\nFinal Verdict: Must visit place for burgers and other continental food", "review_and_follow": ["119", "361"], "rating": "Rated 4.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2015-10-18 21:55:07", "likes": "1", "text": "1 of the best places if u r lukin out for brunch.

Thought there's no better way to come back and start writing for a place which is been raved about so much. Yeah, I'm talking about 'Truffles'. \n\nSo me and my mom decided to try out this place at around 4pm on a weekend. This place was packed and the waiting time to get a table was extending to more than an hour, which made me all the more curious to see what they have to offer. Not wanting my mom to wait, decided to have a takeaway! \n\nOrders : 4.5/5\n1. All American cheese burger - I thought I had the best burgers in chennai until I ordered for this one. I was mind boggled seeing the size of the burger. It had two patties - veg patty and a cheese patty! Additional slice of oozing cheese and mayo enhanced the taste of burger. It was so heavy that it would satisfy two people's hunger. It's a MUST HAVE here! \n\n2. Bulls eye - Even I misinterpreted this thinking it's egg. But surprisingly, it was a gooey 'EGGLESS' chocolate cake. The cake had freshly arrived then and the staff suggested me to go for this and it couldn't get any better. My mom thoroughly enjoyed it too. \n\nStaff : 4/5 \nThe lady taking down names for booking tables was pretty rude but despite that I rate them higher because the Staff (an old man) at the counter helped me with placing orders and was so courteous to give me the freshly arrived desserts. \n\nAmbience : 3.5/5 \nThe ambience is pretty okayish and nothing to rave about. \nDessert display is a sheer eye pleasure! \n\nPricing - 5/5 \nA total VFM place. The burger was for 200 and the dessert for 100 bucks which is a steal! \n\nDEFINITELY revisiting this place to try their other dishes and the drool worthy desserts!", "review_and_follow": ["147", "957"], "rating": "Rated 4.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2015-10-13 23:09:16", "likes": "1", "text": "Good food, Good Ambience and Good service all at very reasonable rates.

But the demand was still strong at 3:30 pm and we were stuck at the 12th position in the queue... Got hold of a table after 30 mins... Since we had to get back to office on time (we had bunked office cafeteria for a better lunch), we ordered the stuff already mentioned in the zomato reviews... All American cheese burgers, Oreo shake, kitkat cake and alfredo pasta... The cheese burgers are best in the city, however I would still prefer an XS or S size to a regular and XL size ;) It was too much for girls like us who have low appetite :P The chips that came along with the burgers were not crispy at all, and tasted bland. Another disappointment was no eggless shakes... While my friends were happily sipping on their Oreo and ferrero rocher shakes, all I could do was click pictures of their yum drinks to upload on zomato :( for desserts, I had ordered kitkat cake sundae since that was an eggless cake... Nd there it came in a tower glass... God!!! Well, I shared and shared until the quantity in the glass was at par with my appetite ... But then it did not turn out to be 'that' yum.. Probably because the cake was eggless... Truffles team, you gotta think hard for your customers who do not eat eggs... I have rated the place 4 for their burgers, pasta and shakes (positive feedback from my friends). I am gonna go back... only for the kickass cheesy-cheese burgers.

Would surely come again to try few more dishes especially some Steak\u2019s and Wraps this time.\n\nOverall Rating:\n\nFood: 5/5\n\nService:4.5/5\n\nAmbiance: 3.5/5", "review_and_follow": ["57", "1080"], "rating": "Rated 4.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2015-09-07 08:29:55", "likes": "1", "text": "I had ordered chicken peri peri.

After that we were given small table which was not good for 4 people so we had to adjust.\n\nWe ordered mushroom soup, orange drink, pasta, double chicken burger, double veg burger, nachos and lasagne.\n\nMushroom soup was very good, orange drink was superb but the burger.\n\nI don't know how to judge it. it was lacking something which makes a burger special. This place is known for burger and listed in kick ass burger list also but i felt it was just normal only size was big. They could have added more liquid and sauce to make it delicious.\n\nlasagne was also okay not great. \n\nThe main thing is we had to wait for 1 hour and the final product was okay but not great.", "review_and_follow": ["29", "121"], "rating": "Rated 3.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2015-08-23 21:25:12", "likes": "1", "text": "Taste: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Ambience: 3.5/5 VFM: 4/5\n\nWas amazed to see the queue outside on Aa Saturday evening when we were placed at a waiting number 33.

Yes it surely lived to my expectation. First started with Frozen Hazelnut and Oreo shake. Oreo shake was better i must say , disappointed with hazelnut , expected to be thicker. Next was The truffles rooster and Crisp cross burgers. They are not spicy but definitely fantastic. Just loved them. The bun, the patty and the sauce were made for each other. Then went with stuffed chicken steak. The chicken breast was perfect. Really did not like the things around it (French fries , gravy , hash brown ) but rice was definitely better. Lastly , recommended by most , the Fererro Roscher cake. Just brilliant. Its smooth and just melts in your mouth. Worth it. Would love visit again. Cheers.:) oh the minus 1 was for the Frozen Hazelnut and the sides in the chicken steak.

Yeaaaaahhh, so on a rainy Wednesday evening we decided to go for Truffles no matter what.\nThis outlet is well known among youngsters, typically college students so you can find a lot of college crowd here coming day night. They don't do any advance booking so u need to walk-in and if you aren't lucky like us then will have to wait on a queue for a table to be free.\nOpposite to forum mall, u can find Truffles in a narrow lane. Since it is not situated in any outside area, you can ask anyone to locate this outlet. An attendant at the main door will take a note of your name and number and will call up your name on your chance followed by an SMS. Pretty organised but the rush herein is crazy.\nNow let's do the talking,\n\nAmbience: 4/5\nSmall compact place with whites,blues and yellows decor...Very young and fresh. Light music in the background jz adds to it as u can sit in peace and talk. \n\nService: 3.5/5\nThough the servers and attendants are polite and we'll known of the menu, bcz of the rush they seem to be very busy overlooking many of the customers. We waited for almost 15-20 minutes for water and 10-15 minutes to find someone who could take our order.\n\nFood:4/5\nWe ordered one veg lasagne, one roast lamb, one ice tea, one ferrero rocher shake and a choco mousse cake.\nLasagne was OK....a bit heavy for me. Roast lamb was good. They served roast lamb with mashed potatoes, rice, and bread alongside. Oh yes,bread was yummm and fresh. Ice tea was good too. Ferrero shake, my god really good. Choco mousse cake was okayish, nthn so great n different.\nBut cake, I found overpriced. Jz a piece of it worth 100 rs. Also, Shake's glasses can be made a bit bigger.\n\nValue for money: 3.5/5\nWell total bill 845. But cake's price disappointed me.\n\nNext visit???

Not only this, the place has an automated system that lets you see your waiting status. That is soooooo cool !!\n\nComing to food, it was amazing. I ordered All American Cheese Burger (Veg) and one of my friend ordered All American Cheese Burger (Non-Veg ), which were amazingly delicious. My friends also ordered Chicken Steak, which they seemed to be enjoying a lot. We also ordered Greek Salad, which I didn't like much. Maybe it was because we ordered very late (at around 11:00 PM) and the ingredients left over were not good, but the cucumber peel was very rough and hard to be chewed. My suggestion to management that cucumber could have either been peeled off in that case or the staff could have very politely cancelled the order saying that salad ingredients are over. I guess that customers of today have become reasonable enough to understand such genuine concerns :) :)\n\nBut nevertheless, an awesome experience. Place is awesome, ambiance and atmosphere is very soothing and menu very refreshing.

In addition to that all the items are tasteful and fulfilling. The paruppu(dal) is a refreshing and an aromatic experience which makes you gobble up excessive amounts of liberally ghee laden rice. The sides seem good to match the spice fueled meal, especially the carrot and cabbage dry curry. As any Andhra meal veteran would have come to expect, the curd is fresh and set. The sweet dish is not so sweet as to tickle your guilt, but just about satisfying to people with sweet tooth syndrome. \nThe Service: For a restaurant that could easily get carried away by it's own towering reputation, Meghana, surprisingly has a team of caring servers and order managers that cares for and importantly observes you while you are under their patronage. All in all, the service is worth the service tax.\nRecommendation:\u00a0 When visiting in a group of three, ordering three separate meals and a single Meghana special biryani makes up for a very satisfying lunch.", "review_and_follow": ["34", "193"], "rating": "Rated 4.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2016-05-21 14:05:42", "likes": "0", "text": "As someone who cannot have spicy food at all, I honestly cannot review this place because I have eaten here twice and I have had tears falling down my eyes like Niagara Falls and hiccups that lasted for hours.

The reason for this overwhelming crowd? Their Killer Biryani. Trust me, you can never get enough of it. This place has been preparing some of the best kind of Biryanis since its inception and they are so consistent with their quality. The other great plus point I see is that the vegetarians are not marginalized or made to feel that Biryani is a non-vegetarian monopoly, they have a decent range to choose from. The non-vegetarians have a great range to choose from and the concept of boneless biryani is what is doing wonders.\n\nThe ambience is quite basic but more than good enough. Once the biryani is there is front of you, which will be in real quick time, you will definitely forget the ambience. The staff is there to take your order quickly and pack you off soon, too. You will find people waiting right next to your table if it seems like you are about to finish, particularly during peak hours. This is pretty common especially during the peak hours. So try to be there just before the peak hours at least. The hygiene is definitely up to the mark and the place is great value for money.\n\nSome of the Biryanis are subtle and some fiery enough to get you going. The sides like the Raita and the Salan (the gravy) compliment the Biryani very well. They are thick, consistent and such great flavour to the Biryani. The quantity of the Biryani is exceptional. It is more than enough for a single person with an average to good appetite. The meals at this place do not match up to the Biryani. It is definitely good but there are many places in Bangalore which offer much better Andhra meals. If you are ordering a meal then do ask for their Ulavacharu, which is a Horse Gram reduction.

And I think this anecdote applies to Meghna foods, here in Koramangala. \nWe ordered a mutton biryani, chicken boneless biryani, nati chicken biryani and a chicken 65.

Veggie 9 yards hash is a mix of veggies (peas, potato, jalapenos, olives), served with omlette and brown bread/ cheese.

The waffle was perfect. Crisp on the outside but soft and sweet on the inside. Not too sweet. It comes with chocolate sauce, I suppose because it did not exactly taste like one. The sauce is way too sweet for my liking.\n\nVeggie House Burger: Your everyday veg burger served with wafers on the side. While the patty wasn't extraordinary, the sauce was really tangy. The burger is quite big.\n\nPeach Iced Tea: I found this way too sweet. But the peach flavour was strong. Fair enough.\n\nFrench Fries: They serve you unsalted fries, which I really prefer because then one can add salt as need be.

We were surprised how such a highly rated place could be so empty on a weekend at peak dinner time. We later understood this place is recommended strictly for breakfast.\n\nThe decor is simple and inexpensive. They have tried to make it quirky to attract college crowd with interesting quotes & frames hung on the wall. The place needs a bit of refurbishment.\n\nWe ordered a Basil Tomato Cheese Sandwich, a House Veggie Burger, Lime & Mint Cooler & a Thumsup.\n\nHere is my take on the food:\n\nBasil tomato Cheese sandwich: This one is made with white bread and is toasted which is strange as I was expecting a universally popular Classic Basil Tomato Cheese sandwich which is made with whole wheat bread and isn\u2019t toasted.\n\nHouse Veggie Burger: This burger taste exactly like Mc Veggie from Mcdonalds. I was a bit taken aback when I took the first bite. This burger is huge. If you are ordering this, make sure you have someone to share it.\n\nLime & Mint Cooler: This one again has a deviation from the classic recipe. It comes with honey and not sugar.\n\nMy overall Verdict:\n\nThis place is strictly for breakfast.\n\nIt is recommended only for college crowd.\n\nIt is not a fancy place.\n\nThis restaurant is rated highly not because of the quality of food but because the portions are huge at an economical price.", "review_and_follow": ["77", "825"], "rating": "Rated 3.0", "comments": "1"}, {"timestamp": "2016-05-02 11:38:38", "likes": "1", "text": "So randomly visited this place and was surprised by its taste.

The decor is made such that it gives a retro feel with really old gramophone records and old exhibits that are displayed around. A lot of college crowd can be seen hanging out here. Also the place is very student friendly and hence, the dishes are very decently priced and very light on the pocket.\nI tried the Naked Veggie Burger which was served as a portion of some fresh salad with lettuce, olives and cherry tomatoes in a dressing , some fries and an aloo patty. The salad was definitely refreshing and loved it. The fries were crisp and nice and served with a mayo. The patty was good too. I liked it :) My friend has the Chicken pasta in white sauce and was not too happy with the taste. But i definitely liked what i tried. :) Also, if you happen to visit this place, do try their waffles. the place is known for their waffles. Also, if you are a non-vegetarian they have something of a burger sorts with some fried chicken and instead of the burger buns, they replace it with the waffles.

The walls has lot of selves with books on them and a sofa as a seat !! The walls also have painted plates and the chairs too are painted!! Sweet ambience which made me happy!! Ample seating is available and crowds up to 20 can be placed together!!\nComing to the good part, i.e. the food,tasted the pizza burger,basically its pizza on a burger bun with lots of mushroom and olives on it!! The chips provided with the Burger was more than most other cafes, then tasted the chocolate waffle with extra whipped cream,like other places the waffle ad-ons are costed extra! The maple syrup was fresh as the flavour was bang on!! The waffle was one of the fluffiest I have ever eaten,full marks to waffle,the juice of the day was gauva or watermelon,took the gauva and realized later whether I would be served Tropicana,but got to say the juice was one of a kind,if I'm right gauva fruit was only blended ,without sugar,with little water in it!! Again full marks for gauva juice,the icing on the cake about this place is everything !! Happy ,neat place!!\nTaste-5/5\nPrice-4/5\nQuality-4.5/5\nQuantity-5/5 (Waffle was of the right size with ample whipped fresh cream)\nWorth it? -I would say this is one of the best place for American !!

After too many failed attempts got to try it two weekends back. \n\nAmbience (3.5/5)\nSimple setup with a fun theme, this place is a perfect setup for a laid back lazy Sunday brunch. On the flip-side, the place can get quite crowded and cramped and seating varies from benches to to cozier options. \n\nPricing (4/5)\nConsidering its located bang opposite to JNC, the pricing is much suited to attract the college crowd. \n\nService (2/5)\nThe biggest letdown in what was otherwise a great meal destination. We ordered a veg burger and made specific request to not add onion and garlic for a jain friend of mine (we also ordered a fried egg separately). \n\nWonder where the smartness arose from, but we were served a perfect jain burger with an egg stuffing in the first shot. Sent it back and what returned was the egg in same plate and a burger stuffed with onions peeping out. I know and appreciate it was a busy day, but there ain't an excuse for such slips.\n\nMy friend gave up after an hour of wait and three attempts of being served a simple veg burger order (with some additional requests of course). \n\nFood\nShould confess, the fried egg in the burger looked inviting and would have definitely gobbled it up if not for the filling food we had before it. Our orders had a sweet touch and is something we realised mid-way through our meal. But why worry when all those who shared the orders had a sweet tooth.\n\nWhat we ate (3.5/5)\n1. Death by waffles: chocolate stuffed waffles with choco chips, choco sauce and choco ice cream to top with. Crazy dish to order if your group has chocolate lovers in it. If you are eating alone, feel free to feel guilty for the rest of the year for the calories consumed.\n\nI was wowed by it, but my marginal consumption index played a tolerance barrier in enjoying it to the end. \n\n2. Funky monkey waffles\nWaffles topped with cream, bananas and choco sauce. Comparable to main stream waffle dishes - this is a dish I enjoyed better when I could have no more of the death by waffles. \n\n3. French toast\nA tad too sweet. Was miles off the benchmark for good french toasts. \n\nOn a summary note, they have a few fine dishes but need to improve on service.

I went straight for pancakes with homemade chocolate sauce and a bananago (banana + lemonade) drink. Common appetiser was hash browns as neither of us tried it before funnily.

However, one was one underdone and the other dry, both had a lingering doughy taste. The underdone pancake had the wet batter in between cooked dough. I could not even look at it anymore, forget clicking pics. \nMy drink was nothing but banana milkshake. The strawberry lemonade drink was tangy and  refreshing.\nWaiters are a dazed lot and strive to impress by walking up and down tables no less than 100 times.

You will only be able to eat desert here, which too contains eggs. The rest, please read on...\n\nPARKING & ENTRY\n\n\u00a0- 2/5 - This place is diagonally opposite to JNC college. As you can imagine, it has no space to park in and around. There is no valet service, though if you were expecting any this is not the place for you. The place also is difficult to spot, as it is on the first floor.\n\nRESERVATION & SEATING\n\n\u00a0- 3/5 - You need to have prior reservation at this place to get a table on arrival. It is not possible for you to just arrive are get a table. Seating is acceptable, nothing great. It servers it purpose though. The place has outdoor seating for about 8-10 people.\n\nEXPERIENCE & AMBIENCE\n\n\u00a0- 3/5 - The one major negative thing about this place is the time it takes for you to get your food. Also, it will come arbitrarily, not in a logical order such as drinks with mains and then deserts. The ambiance is very nice, the place has no air conditioning or WiFi. They have a very nice sign that says ,\"Live like its 1993, no WiFi.\" It is sometimes difficult to explain the order to the waiters. The place has a very cafe like feel, which is a well done. Another lovely thing about this place is that it will allow you to get your pet, as long as you do not cause any trouble for the rest of the guests. We saw a friendly pug here.\n\nALCOHOL\n\n\u00a0- N/A - Does not serve.\n\nFOOD\u00a0\n\u00a0- 5/5 - Coming down to the food, this place has one of the best burgers I have tasted in all of Bangalore. Something that you must try. Its called the double chicken cheese burger without any bacon. Do care to add crispy onions. Also, make sure to ask the waiter to serve it to you hot, which is the real experience of the burger. The second great dish that they serve is called \"Stuff on toast\" where you will get to choose 4 of 12 options and add cheese to the same. You have ample choices, and you can really make a lovely toast with Jalape\u00f1o and Mushrooms. Thirdly they have a omelette called the skillet omelette. This is really tasty and well made. Something vegetarians can go for, in case they eat eggs. You can make a pass on the hash browns, they are below average. \n\nDESSERTS\n\n\u00a0- 5/5 - The chocolate chip waffles are very well made, and it was pointed out to me by Snigdha Shankar that they are ridiculously light. They have lovely waffles called the \"Banaffee Waffles\" which involves banana's, toffee syrup, and whipped cream. Their chocolate waffles are average though, as the chocolate is not very evident in the waffle.\n\nEXPENSE - 5/5 - This place is really affordable. Four people can comfortably eat here within Rs. 1500.

Then we ordered for a chilli paneer burger , baked pasta , mashed potatoes, veggie omelette , chocolate milkshake n banana milkshake :p The best was chilli paneer burger in which the paneer was tossed n prepared to taste good between the buns. Mashed potatoes was also perfect with right amount of salt. Veggie omelette was also a good order but the baked pasta was a disappointment since it tasted really bland and a definite improvement is needed on that. As a drink chocolate milkshake tasted really good which gave a good end to our brunch :) A great place to hang out with your friends and have good food at the same time :)", "review_and_follow": ["35", "79"], "rating": "Rated 4.0", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2015-09-12 17:46:44", "likes": "5", "text": "Die because you ate \u00a0a lamb burger too many \u00a0 with extra bacon and a fried egg .

Omelettes are a must have over here! \nAmong sandwiches, the sausage sandwich, honey mustard chicken and grilled chicken salad sandwich are my favourites. Extremely filling and tasty as well.

My hot chocolate came to the table fast enough.

The people strolling to and fro and those beautiful lights just makes it a perfect place for a delightful dinner.\n\nMy eyes first set on Bob's Hash Brown Omelette as I looked into the menu. We also ordered the all-day Farmer's Breakfast. The former is a nice concept of Omelette cooked along with Hash Browns, the experiment worked successfully. I liked the dish, but its quite filling. The Farmer's Breakfast was also decent. Typical English Breakfast served with Baked Beans, Mashed Potatoes, Mushrooms, Spinach, Tomatoes and Brown Bread. A healthy meal if you want to try it out. Next up was the Chilli Paneer Burger which was one of the day's special. Quite spicy and fiery on the tongue, but I wish they had added Scrambled Paneer or a Patty instead of Paneer Cubes, It makes the burger quite difficult to eat. It was alright, nothing that great. Wanted to try their Waffles, but was quite full and could barely eat anything else. That's for some other time. Did try their Peanut Butter & Banana Milkshake, it went well along with my meal. Another drink we tried was the Hot Cocoa. Nothing special about it, quite similar to a Cappuccino.\n\nThe service was attentive and courteous.

The buffet spread is good enough with 3-4 starters in both veg and non veg along with two welcome drinks. My review is based on nonveg dishes i tried. The chicken soup served was ultimate and very refreshing with pinch of peppery taste, very light and creamy. In starters, I liked mainly their chicken kabab and Amritsar fish fry. Rest hariyali chicken tikka and seekh kabab were also good and correctly spiced. There was also separate counter for yummy chaat and pakoras.\nIn the main course, there was only 2 gravies in non veg section along with chicken dum biryani. Butter chicken gravy was creamy but the tanginess was missing in it. Chicken pieces were on the bone and nicely grilled. Last Maas preparation was very nice. I really liked the texture and proportion of spice used in gravy. It really went well with butter naan. Also chicken biryani had been given full justice and overdone anything with its authenticity.\nNow coming to the desserts but the taste and experience is very good to the price they are quoting for the buffet...\nThe dessert section was the plus point as they were providing freshly made hot jalebi with cold rabdi and lots of other dishes like gulab jamun, gajar kahalwa, 3 different flavours of mousse which was mildly sweet very appropriate, 4-5 different flavours of ice creams, pastries and many sliced fruits.....All together a great experience with good food\nOne suggestion from my side is that they should serve welcome drink in normal shake glasses rather than mini shot glasses.

Had quite an amazing time, especially with the non-veg starters. Read on for more insight into why we liked the place quite a bit.\n\nPARKING & ENTRY\n- 4.5/5 - The place is situated in BluPetal hotel on JNC road. They have valet parking. The valet parks your car within the hotel itself, keeping it safer than usual. The place is easy to find and catches your eye quickly. You may encounter traffic while getting here though, as the roads are narrow.\n\nRESERVATION & SEATING\n- 4.5/5 - We called around 7:30 PM for a 9 PM reservation, and we got it conveniently. The person on the phone was swift and friendly. There is ample seating, about 60-80 people could sit inside the restaurant. It is well air conditioned. The seating is really comfortable, and they have a lovely waiting area. We didn't actually have to wait though.\n\nEXPERIENCE & AMBIENCE\n- 4.5/5 - The place has mellow music, and its very well lit. There are impressive bronze ornaments kept in the space. The seating is well spaced. The chairs are quite comfortable. The waiters seem to be trained \u00a0and are quite polite. Every \"Thank You\" was acknowledged by the staff!\n\nALCOHOL\n- N/A - While we did not indulge in any alcohol, the place has a special off for Rs. 99+Tax for a few drinks. It seemed worthwhile, but we were not here with that purpose.\n\nFOOD\n- 3.5/5 - The place has delicious disk called \"Tandoori Kukkad\". Please do give this a try. If you love chicken it is definitely a must have. Keep in mind though, it is NOT boneless. The main course was average, we expected more from the dishes here. We ordered the Laccha Paneer Roghini & Kadai Subzi Desi. The Paneer was where a lot of improvement could be made, while the Kadai Sabzi was average. The Roti's were really good, I'd recommend the Amritsari Kulcha stuffed with Paneer or Aloo. We had an option to take the buffet, but we chose not to.\n\nDESSERTS\n- N/A - While they seemed interesting, we had already decided to go to stoner which is nearby.\n\nEXPENSE - 3/5 - Amongst the 5 of us, we spent around 1860 including tax. I find that to be reasonable, and we left satisfied.

Located near JNC main gate. They offer both a la-carte and buffet. We choose buffet. The buffet doesn't have many variety of dishes, the price is resonable for such widespread buffet. The ambience is rich, cultural, royal and calm. They have a open kitchen. \n There's complimentary welcome drink of 2 flavours, badam sharbat and purple ka phool. In the buffet menu they have 4 non-veg and 5 veg starters, 6 veg and 1 non-veg salads, 3 non-veg and 6 veg main course and desserts. \n  \n  Veg Starters- I've tried the paneer, aloo and seekh starters. Panner tikka is good. The Panner is soft and tikka paste is spicy. Aloo starter is small wedges of potato deep fried with added salt and spices. The seekh is flavourful and soft. \n\n  Non-veg Starters- I've tried the chicken, fish and mutton starters. There are 2 chicken starters, Tandoori Chicken and Murgh Ki Chatpata. Tandoori Chicken was tender and spicy. Murgh Ki Chatpata is grilled chicken which was delicious. The tawa fish fry is soft and delicious. Mutton Murraba Kebab is spicy, tender and flavourful. \n\n  They do have soups, not worth more than taste. There's live Chaat counter. We took mixed veg pakoda. It's Panner, potato, onion, babycorn etc dipped in flour batter and deep fried. \n\n  Non-veg Main Course- There was chicken biryani, butter chicken and Kalimirch ka Gosht. Butter chicken, gravy smooth and sweet chicken, tender. Kalimirch ka Gosht, well cooked and flavored mutton, the gravy is spicy. Chicken Biryani was divine. Spicy and flavourful rice. Well cooked and spiced chicken. \n\n  Dessert- Malai Pista Ghewar is a cripy flour base soaked in sugar syrup and topped with Pistachio. Jahangir was crispy and big but too sweet. Angoori Aam ka Kheer is small Rasgulla soaked in Mango puree. Mango moose was smooth and delicious. Jaggery cake was too good, soft and unique taste. Fresh fruits like Mango, muskmelon, watermelon etc were there. In ice creams there were vanilla, chocolate, Mango and butterscotch. Mango ice cream would be my pick, its a fresh fruit ice cream, too delicious. Chocolate ice cream could not have been better with the thick chocolate sauce! \n\n  Service is good. The quality is very good. There's nothing in buffet spread that tasted bad. Kudos to the chef! Although the no. of non veg dish were less. It's worth the money.

It is but natural that a restaurant which claims anything \"royal\", either in its nomenclature or in the cuisine that it seeks to represent, would create expectations of grandeur & opulence.\n\nBut, right from the word go, there is absolutely nothing Sultan-like here. Everything is the opposite, from the location to the building to the cramped waiting areas and to the astonishing lack of enough restrooms (1 common restroom for about 100 people and at times, the queue outside it can be very misleading, especially with it being in the lobby & just as one comes out of the elevator !!).\n\nMost importantly, the food, which, had it been grand or even near-grand, would have made me overlook all the other inadequacies. The milling crowd and a 4.0 rating here is a complete red-herring.\n\nThe proceedings start off with a soup - Tomato Shorba and a Chicken Mint Shorba, both of which are unworthy of mention. The latter, devoid of real flavour, had a pungent zing of the mint & probably, coriander powder too.\n\nThe non-veg starters were dominated by Chicken items and had just 1 Mutton item. Of the Chicken items, only a Murgh Taftaan (I think?) and the Chicklen Legs were of note. The Mutton Seekh Kabab was shockingly bland & dry !!\n\nThe one item that was much in demand was the Pav - with Veg Bhaji &/or Mutton Kheema. And this particular counter was the most crowded of all. Although, they were quite stingy with the bhaji / kheema and one had to embarassingly ask for more to be served.\n\nThe Main Course had a decent number of items. The Sarson da Saag & Dal Sultani (=Makhani) were average while the Kabuli Pulao was nice & flavourful on its own. The Dal Makhani I feel is a Litmus test - getting it right would more often than not mean that we can also look forward to your other dishes. The Nizami Mutton Biriyani, though somewhat tasty, had its seasoning a little out of place.\n\nSurprisingly, they served a-very-out-of-place dish at a North Indian buffet- the curd rice. But like George Calombaris on Masterchef Australia says, if you're not sure of what (& how) you've made something, then don't serve it all !! The rice morsels were hard & seemed stale, with the whole dish tasting so un-fresh. Absolutely unforgivable that they served something like this !\n\nThe Desserts comprised - Gulab Jamun (slightly sour tasting jamun), Rasagulla (ok), Caramel Custard (good), Orange Mousse (just ok), cut-fruits, a few flavours of ice-cream.\n\nService - Passable. They seem automatically \"not attuned' to process a request and it needed some amount of persuasion to make them change \"routine\".\n\nVFM - We were about 25-27 of us and the bill came to about Rs. 18k (inclusive of some 10% discount, I'm told).\n\nVerdict - I'm not sure if it was an off-day. Giving a few dishes royal-sounding names just won't cut it, if the taste is lacking.

The buffet was decent with the live counter serving pineapple, apple and chilly jalebis, starters were okayish, not bad, nothing special to mention about main course. \n3/5 for food and their \"management policy\".", "review_and_follow": ["108", "2229"], "rating": "Rated 3.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2015-10-14 13:57:24", "likes": "1", "text": "Nice north Indian food.

Garnished with gems and chocochips actually gives you a Disney feel. A perfect colorful ice cream which will fascinate the kids. A little on the sweeter side also gives a bubblegum kind of a taste. Recommended only for those who are fond of strawberry flavour, mind it strawberry \"flavour\" and that bubblegummy sweet taste. \nCARAMEL CUSTARD- Oh my dear Lord, now this is called a cone full of yummy happiness. Butterscotch and vanilla ice cream mixed well with pureed figs and caramel sauce. Once when mixed together is garnished with caramel custard. Isn't too sweet in taste, it's perfect for those who're fond of caramel custard. That blend of custard, ice cream and figs takes you on a heavenly trip.\nSNICKER SURPRISE- Strawberry and chocolate ice cream are beaten up well together with caramel sauce and pics of snicker chocolate. When mixed well liquor flavored sauce is put in to enhance the taste. Slightly on the bitter side because of the liquor sauce keeps you wanting for more because the strawberry ice cream and the snicker pieces maintain the balance of keeping it sweet. \nICE TEA- One of the best mint lemon ice tea's I have had till date.

Well, this prompted the folks from Stoner to open another outlet in the busy Jyothi Nivas College road.  This road also has quite a few restaurant and ice cream place but then the popularity of this no less compared to other brands.  Let me share my experience over here.\n\nLocation \nIf you are on the JNC College road, you will need to drive down almost until you hit the Hosur Adugodi Road.  But then just before that there is Dice\u2019N\u2019Dine shop and the Stoner is located next to it.\n\nAmbiance\nThis is a huge place for having an ice cream outlet.  But then they have done with a purpose to let people have a great time. There are the typical Cold Stones that are kept to one side where the ice cream mixes happen.\nA much better looking facility compared to the Indranagar outlet.\n\nFood / Ice cream\nThere is time when you get so desperate to eat something that you want to go all out to get it.  It happened to me on one of the Fridays when they told that the store closes by 11.30pm and that they don\u2019t accept phone order.  I reached right on time but then they had taken often the cold-stone but had to settle for their individual flavours.  This is what I felt bad coz I thought I was the last customer and also my family was with me.  The person just out rightly denied which I thought was not good.\n\nBut yes, I got 2 different flavoured ice cream coz it did not have the of beating on the cold-stone.  Got the Mango and Chocolate flavours.  \n\nThe flavours of the chocolate were really good.  But yes, I thought they could have handled customer service better. \n\nOverall Experience\nThere are some good bad experiences visiting this place.  But I sometimes think it\u2019s the location that makes them get the extra zing.  That should surely be curtailed by the person.  My rating for this place is 3.5/5. But surely it\u2019s got the potential.  \nMy rating in other departments are as follows \u2013\nFood \u2013 3.5/5\nService \u2013 3.0/5\nAmbiance \u2013 3.5/5\nFood for 2 at this place will cost anywhere between INR 350 \u2013 600.\n                                            fodyssey.com", "review_and_follow": ["502", "3041"], "rating": "Rated 3.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2016-03-08 21:25:41", "likes": "3", "text": "Amazing amazing and more amazing.

They serve it in pretty wafers. I have even ordered ice cream from home and they gave it nicely packed - wafer separately and ice cream separately.

Well, this prompted the folks from Stoner to open another outlet in the busy Jyothi Nivas College road.  This road also has quite a few restaurant and ice cream place but then the popularity of this no less compared to other brands.  Let me share my experience over here.\n\nLocation \nIf you are on the JNC College road, you will need to drive down almost until you hit the Hosur Adugodi Road.  But then just before that there is Dice\u2019N\u2019Dine shop and the Stoner is located next to it.\n\nAmbiance\nThis is a huge place for having an ice cream outlet.  But then they have done with a purpose to let people have a great time. There are the typical Cold Stones that are kept to one side where the ice cream mixes happen.\nA much better looking facility compared to the Indranagar outlet.\n\nFood / Ice cream\nThere is time when you get so desperate to eat something that you want to go all out to get it.  It happened to me on one of the Fridays when they told that the store closes by 11.30pm and that they don\u2019t accept phone order.  I reached right on time but then they had taken often the cold-stone but had to settle for their individual flavours.  This is what I felt bad coz I thought I was the last customer and also my family was with me.  The person just out rightly denied which I thought was not good.\n\nBut yes, I got 2 different flavoured ice cream coz it did not have the of beating on the cold-stone.  Got the Mango and Chocolate flavours.  \n\nThe flavours of the chocolate were really good.  But yes, I thought they could have handled customer service better. \n\nOverall Experience\nThere are some good bad experiences visiting this place.  But I sometimes think it\u2019s the location that makes them get the extra zing.  That should surely be curtailed by the person.  My rating for this place is 3.5/5. But surely it\u2019s got the potential.  \nMy rating in other departments are as follows \u2013\nFood \u2013 3.5/5\nService \u2013 3.0/5\nAmbiance \u2013 3.5/5\nFood for 2 at this place will cost anywhere between INR 350 \u2013 600.\n                                            fodyssey.com", "review_and_follow": ["502", "3041"], "rating": "Rated 3.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2016-03-08 21:25:41", "likes": "3", "text": "Amazing amazing and more amazing.

Chocolates dont go wrong usually and it was perfect here. The mango was pretty good but apple crumb was the best. You could actually feel the crumble and apple taste and oh my god it was so good. They serve it in pretty wafers. I have even ordered ice cream from home and they gave it nicely packed - wafer separately and ice cream separately. I thought the amount of ice cream they give while home delivery ismore than what they give at the outlet itself. Price is worth it.

I have tried all their chicken pizzas, and they are all aweosme. Hot garlic and barbeque chicken are my favourite. Though they have a small menu, options are quite less in non-veg section. Being said that, the veg options are no less in taste either. Especially the Creamy Cheese Pizza, of which it was hard to get a slice, (ahem! Navya Bailkeri ). It was absolutely delicious. Let's move on to the burgers, again, a smaller menu. They don't come with cheese, you need to get it added, although the bottle of Mayo on your table should more than suffice. Burgers aren't juicy enough, you can skip them and you will not be missing much. To the ice creams, their speciality. I have assumed that this place is called stoner because they mix ice creams on a tablet of stone. Now I am not sure, it could be a bit more figurative, as it is commonly used. Regardless, they have amazing preparations to offer. Do check out the specials on the board near the checkout counter.

Cute tables with paper glasses and water bottle, stack cards with stoner slogans, and a wall of traditional designs on one side, classic lamps, quite the hocus pocus here.

The nutty fudgy was also a complete delight \u2013 loaded with cashews and almonds, while the red velvet had mixed feelings. They had also started burgers that day, so I tried their BBQ Chicken burger, quite well, just basics though. For cheese and jalapenos etc, they are add ons to the burger.

However the seating is painful. Even a prison canteen has more comfortable seats. Firstly no chairs stools and benches. Stools are hard wood no cushion no back rest. Now this place serves both food and ice cream . So do they expect customers to sit down for extended periods on such painfully uncomfortable seats. To call the owner architect clueless would be giving them a compliment. Completely ignorant about the restaurant business. There is a direct correlation between seating comfort and sales. Whike eating I heard a loud metallic repetitive noise I thought their compressor was giving problems yes it was that loud. I go and check it's this bozo at the counter making a big racket trying to mix ice cream with knives. Even a butcher cuts meat with less racket. For heavens sake mixing ice cream should be a noiseless operation with a spatula not butcher knives. This stone mixing concept was started by Coldstone Creamery in the USA. The company has filed for bankruptcy a while ago. It was a concept that added too much cost without giving value.\n\nCLEANLINESS\nVery high impeccable standards of cleanliness and hygiene\n\nSERVICE\nQuick efficient except the guy at cashier counter lacks customer service skills very cold and unfriendly\n\nFOOD\nTried their fruitlicious which is strawberry with fruits. Rs 140 Served in a cone in a small cup. The serving is about two scoops. OUTSTANDING CREAMY FRESH FLAVOR:SILKY SMOOTH THICK BRIMMING WITH STRAWBERRY FLAVOR . Definitely among the best in Bangalore . Much better than the garbage at Pabrais and the mediocre stuff at Berry'd Alive and Corner Stone Very comparable to Thanco. Fruits were chopped so fine that couldn't taste their flavor. Cone was fresh crisp very tasty. Then they have cups and water and tissues on every table. Very nice. Flavors of ice cream are very limited. I think only 10. Compare with Baskin Robbins at 31\n\nSECOND TRIP\nTried their Green Burger. Mouth Watering and healthy Spinach Peas patty with Green Chutney Mayonnaise. Spices were well blended and Bun was superior. Rs 120 Friends this Burger far surpasses the overhyped garbage at Truffles minus the crowds . See pic\n\nSUMMARY\nOverall the owners have a good concept but still have a long ways to go in making this a top notch place. Spent way too much on decor and in the wrong places. Overall Definitely worth a try. The regular food in this place is AMAZING.

Lots of seating arrangements, extremely bright interiors overall a pleasant happy ambience. \nThe ice cream options are pretty much the same, though I spotted a few new varieties which is apple crumble and tiramisu. They have increased the variety of pizzas they used to offer earlier, very unique combination of toppings for both veg and non veg. There's a new addition which is burger menu, which comes in single and double patty as well. The description was very appealing but was too full to try any. \nSo visited this outlet for the first time, had a strawberry shake, monkey business and kiddy Kat. \nThe strawberry shake was very very sugary and excessively sweet. Just didn't like it, only the little pulp they'd put tasted okay, the quantity of the shake for the price charged is too less. \nMoving on, monkey business was a great pick, bananas blended with ice cream and Choco chips tasted great. The kiddy Kat was a new choice for me, and I loved it. Lots of gems, Kitkat, choc chips and tutti fruity blended with strawberry ice cream, exceptionally good. My other favourites here are caramel custard and Choco lava. \nService is good but if there's a little crowd you'll see the place going haywire. A little more management is needed. \nPricing wise, around 120-170 rupees per ice cream and shakes around 120-150 rupees which I don't feel is worth it. Burgers and pizzas cost you around 170-250 rupees easily. \nNow don't get mistaken by the looks of ice cream, it seems a lot but it actually is NOT! \nThe taste of almost all varieties of ice creams are good, yet to try their food. \nGo here if you still haven't, you'll love it.", "review_and_follow": ["180", "1248"], "rating": "Rated 3.5", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2015-09-30 11:13:55", "likes": "2", "text": "A lot of eateries get business, just because I have to wait for my my wife outside her office in JNC Road.

So eventually whatever came was the result of all the beating that two flavors of ice cream got topped with a choco lava cake. This is what I got and loved it. Wont call is path breaking but good. I might come by for more ice creams.\u00a0\n\nStaff - Staff is attentive. But since most of the ordering part is on your own, they do not matter.\u00a0\n\nPrices - Though I have been trained better by Corner house, this is still expensive. Rs.170/- for one cup of the ice cream is still on the expensive side.\u00a0\n\nPS : They \u00a0have other stuff to eat too.

The decor is pretty unconventional. A series of ornate discs crowded a vast expanse of the wall on one side, while the one on the other side was coated with a metal mesh from the bottom, with vines covering up the top. Maybe it was just me, but the interior seemed pretty Kubrick-esque. A welcome and unique touch was the presence of a bottle of water and paper cups on all the tables. Furthermore, all the tables had a rectangular slab of stone in the centre, apparently without any use, but I guess (and hope) that was just to keep in sync with the name.\n\nWe had already had our dinner, and were only looking for a desserts' place when we arrived here. The Nutty Fudgy seemed more delicious than the other ice-creams in the menu, and the three of us ordered one bowl to be shared amongst us. As the name promised, it was full of cashews and almonds, and quite fudgy too. The wafer was crispy, and the intricately designed piece of chocolate jutting out delicious. Overall, we were quite happy with our choice for the night.\n\nBangalore has quite a few good ice-cream parlors, and Stoner is a delightful addition to the list. This eatery is worth multiple visits, and the next time I would love to taste something from the main course.", "review_and_follow": ["158", "493"], "rating": "Rated 4.0", "comments": "0"}, {"timestamp": "2015-09-26 22:41:10", "likes": "2", "text": "I was so happy seeing Stoner opening its outlet in Koramangala.
